Let's analyse how our `if` statement works.

```python
  if keyCode == 'LEFT':
    moveLeft()
```

An `if` statement starts with 

```python
if some condition is true:
```

**You start your line with `if`** and then ask the question you are interested in. At the end of the line, you add a `:`. 

**If** this condition is true, then you execute all the instructions that come after it that are indented at the same level. There is only one instruction in this example.

## Code blocks
The `:` at the end of the `if` line denotes the start of a code block. As explained above, you can then add any number of instructions on the following lines as long as they are indented by 2 spaces.
