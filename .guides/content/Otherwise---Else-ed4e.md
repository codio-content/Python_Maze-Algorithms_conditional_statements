So far we have dealt with the case "if a condition is true, then do something".

We are now going to deal with the case "if a condition is true, then do something **otherwise** do something else".

This is actually quite simple. Take a look at the code on the left and you should be able to see what is happening. 

```python
if condition is True:
  do something
else:
  do something else
```

In our code, we are actually saying "if the left arrow key is pressed then move to the left **otherwise** move to the right ".

Notice that the `else` statement comes after the the indented `if condition:` code block and has the the same indentation as the `if  condition:`.

## Play
Try this out now by pressing the right arrow key or another key (any key on the keyboard in fact) and see what happens.
