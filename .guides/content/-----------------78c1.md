We're now going to introduce some other very useful tests apart from just `==`.

Here's a table to refer to when we do some challenges in a moment.

| Code | Spoken |
| - | - |
| `if getEnergy() != 0:`       | If energy is not equal to 0 | 
| `if getEnergy() > 30:`       | If energy is greater than 30 | 
| `if getEnergy() >= 30:`      | If energy is greater than or equal to 30 | 
|  `if getEnergy() < 10:`       | If energy is less than 10 |
| `if getEnergy() <= 30:`       | If energy is less than or equal to 30 |
