As with most technical stuff, **Conditional Statements** is a long winded way of saying something simple we understand in the real world. In this case, what we mean by a conditional statement is **if**.

## Real World
Let's start off with some real world examples.

- If the water is boiling, put an egg in.
- If it is raining, put up your umbrella.
- If the sun is shining, put on your sunglasses otherwise take them off.

## Game Examples
In our game, we could use these examples.

- If the user presses the up arrow key, move the player up one
- If the user has reached the exit, show a message "Well done".
- If the energy level is less than 0, game over.
