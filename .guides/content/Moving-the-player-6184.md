A really nice way of introducing `if` statements is to show how you can control the movement of the player yourself.

Take a look at the flowchart on the left. You can see the logic used here to decide what action to take.

- If the up arrow is pressed, move the player up
- If the down arrow is pressed, move the player down
- If the left arrow is pressed, move the player left
- If the right arrow is pressed, move the player right
